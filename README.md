# Java-EE-Security
(Under construction!)
A customized Java EE security module for Jax-RS endpoints.

Goal: Secure a JAX-RS RESTful API with a customized Java-EE compliant security module.

I started working on it to get more familiar with the Java EE security standards, and perhaps help others with this as well.

The project is under construction. So far it has been tested and works on Wildfly 25.

# How it works
The user authenticates either with a username and a password (Basic Authentication), or with a token. 

Short description of the algorithm:
  1. The validity of the credentials or token is checked.
  2. If the creds are valid, and the user is not currently active somewhere else, the user reaches the endpoints without a problem. A token is generated if 
  the user logged in with username and password and has chosen "remember me".
  3. If the user is currently active from another session, both sessions are invalidated, and the user is notified for a possible security issue (a response from the website and/or an email about a suspicious login and that his credentials might have been compromised).
  
Each request is an HttpServletRequest assosiated with an HttpSession generated by the server when first contacted by a client. 
If the credentials are valid, a Login object associated with the HttpSession is generated. The object contains not only the session, but
details such as the ipAddress, the User-agent, the token (if any), etc. 
The login-object is an HttpSessionBindingListener, which means that it "dies" as soon as the 
HttpSession expires, removing itself from the hashmap.

The application keeps a hashmap with usernames and login-objects (i.e. usernames associated with active sessions and ip addresses).
When a login object is created (i.e. when there is a new HttpSession), is stored along with the assosiated user in that hashmap. 
When a user tries to authenticate, the authentication mechanism checks whether there is an active session for the user, i.e. whether there is 
a key for the username in the hashmap. If any, both sessions are invalidated, along with any tokens to the user
(and ideally the application notifies the user that their credentials might have been compromised).

With the current implementation of the mechanism, if one uses this module for a website, the users may receive an email for suspicious login attempts in case they e.g. delete their cookies without logging out first, and then try to login again before the session expires (less than half a minute of inactivity for a token-authenticated user, up to several minutes of inactivity for a username/password-authenticated user that rejected the cookies or did not choose "remember me").
